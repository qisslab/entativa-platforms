║  Yo! This is Neo Qiss here 👋 Just a crazy dev experimenting with AI/ML     ║
║  algorithms that might be getting a bit too powerful for my own good 😅     ║
║                                                                              ║
║  🤖 This Frankenstein algorithm is my baby, my art, my sleepless nights     ║
║  🎯 If it works: My sanity stays intact. If it breaks: I accept full blame  ║
║  ⚠️  If this ever causes harm: I take FULL responsibility (it's on me!)     ║

║  🚨 PSA: These are MY original ideas - please don't copy and snitch 🙏      ║
║  💪 I sacrificed A LOT for this, so respect the hustle and creativity       ║
║  🎨 This is pure art in code form - admire it, learn from it, but DON'T     ║
║      steal it. There's a special place in dev hell for code thieves 😈     ║
