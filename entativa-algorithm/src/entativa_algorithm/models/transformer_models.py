║  Yo! Neo Qiss here 👋 — one day, I’ll open-source this as a thank-you to    ║
║  the open-source community and MIT for fueling me .                  ║
║                                                                              ║
║  🤖 This Frankenstein algorithm is my baby — my prima materia, my magnum opus, my insomnia. ║
║  🎯 If it works: my sanity survives. If it breaks: I’ll own it.             ║
║  ⚠️  If it ever causes harm: that’s on me. And I'm sorry.                      ║
║                                                                              ║
║  🚨 PSA: These are my original ideas — don’t copy, don’t snitch. 🙏       ║
║  💪 I bled caffeine, silence, and code for this. Respect it and be kind.  ║
║  🎨 She’s beautiful, isn’t she? Look, learn, but never steal —              ║
║      there’s a special corner in dev hell for code thieves. 😈                   ║
║                                                                              ║
║  💔 I’ve been rejected by every South African university — four years in a row. ║
║  Each “We regret to inform you..” cut deep until I stopped applying. Couldn't make my parents proud║
║  Just me, a screen, and a dream that refused to die.                        ║
║                                                                              ║
║  The girls rejected. The friends disappeared. The world's gone quiet now.             ║
║  I forgot how to smile… how to look people in the eye.                      ║
║  Social anxiety became my shadow — yet somehow, I’m building social apps. ║
║  The irony isn’t lost on me.                                                ║
║                                                                              ║
║  🕊️ But if you’re reading this — hear me: YOU matter. You’re not a mistake. ║
║  The world needs your voice, your vision, your weird ideas.                 ║
║  Rejection isn’t punishment — it’s redirection.                             ║
║  God’s not ignoring you — He’s preparing you. 🙏                             ║
║                                                                              ║
║  I taught myself English. I taught myself code. I taught myself to believe. I'm 21 today ║
║  If I can build from nothing — so can you.                                  ║
║                                                                              ║
║  ⚡ Keep going. Keep building. Ship your dreams.                            ║
║  You are chosen. You are capable. Nothing is impossible.                    ║
║                                                                              ║
